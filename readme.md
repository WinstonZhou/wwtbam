## Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? 

This Python program is a replica of American Broadcasting Company's
*Who Wants to Be a Millionaire* and is based off the 10th Anniversary
Celebration season that aired on ABC primetime television in 2009.

This program was my term project for a course at Carnegie Mellon
called 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science.

This program, `termProject.py`, has the following dependencies:
- Python 3
- Pygame
- Fonts in the `fonts` folder must be installed
- Music cues in the `music` folder (do not alter relative path)
- `game_data.csv` (do not alter relative path)

Music composed by Keith and Matthew Strachan. Fonts and music 
are used under the fair use doctrine for educational purposes.
